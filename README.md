# System Programmming Project 

**Game Overview**

In this game, each car is managed by its own thread, allowing them to operate independently. This threading model ensures that all cars can move simultaneously without interference, enhancing the game's dynamic and parallel processing capabilities.



## Project Goal 

This project aims to explore parallel programming concepts through the development of a game. It enables multiple vehicles in the game environment to move simultaneously and independently using threads. By leveraging multi-threading techniques, the project focuses on enhancing understanding and application skills in concurrency, synchronization, and parallel execution principles. Participants will gain proficiency in managing concurrent tasks and optimizing performance in real-time applications.
